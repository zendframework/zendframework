Welcome to the Zend Framework 2.0.0 Release! 

RELEASE INFORMATION
---------------
Zend Framework 2.0.0dev1

THIS RELEASE IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE AND NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.
PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

At this time, we have tested all functionality of Zend\Tool, and followed the
Quick Start application instructions, and all functionality works as it did in
the ZF1 series of releases. However, most Zend\Service components have not been
migrated to namespaces, and Zend\Db has not been completely vetted (in favor of
doing a complete refactor). Again, please use at your own risk, and be prepared
for major changes in APIs in the development and alpha milestones prior to the
first beta release.
