    <title>Zend_File_Transfer</title>

    <para>
        <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname> provides extensive support for file uploads and
        downloads. It comes with built-in validators for files plus functionality to change files
        with filters. Protocol adapters allow <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname> to expose
        the same <acronym>API</acronym> for transport protocols like <acronym>HTTP</acronym>, FTP,
        WEBDAV and more.

        <title>Limitation</title>
        <para>
            The current implementation of <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname> is limited to
            <acronym>HTTP</acronym> Post Uploads. Other adapters supporting downloads and other
            protocols will be added in future releases. Unimplemented methods will throw an
            exception. For now, you should use
            <classname>Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http</classname> directly. As soon as
            there are multiple adapters available you can use a common interface.
        </para>
    </note>

    <note>
        <title>Forms</title>
        <para>
            When you are using <classname>Zend_Form</classname> you should use the
            <acronym>API</acronym>s provided by <classname>Zend_Form</classname> and not
            <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname> directly. The file transfer support in
            <classname>Zend_Form</classname> is implemented with
            <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname>, so the information in this chapter may
            be useful for advanced users of <classname>Zend_Form</classname>.

    <para>
        The usage of <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname> is relatively simple. It consists of
        two parts. The <acronym>HTTP</acronym> form does the upload, while the
        <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname> handles the uploaded files. See the following
        example:
    </para>

    <example id="zend.file.transfer.introduction.example">
        <title>Simple Form for Uploading Files</title>
        <para>
            This example illustrates basic file uploading.
            The first part is the file form. In our example there is one file to upload.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/file/upload" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="100000" />
        Choose a file to upload: <input name="uploadedfile" type="file" />
    <br />
    <input type="submit" value="Upload File" />
</form>
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
           For convenience, you can use <link
               linkend="zend.form.standardElements.file">Zend_Form_Element_File</link> instead of
           building the HTML manually.
        </para>
        <para>
            The next step is to create the receiver of the upload. In our example the receiver is
            located at <code>/file/upload</code>. So next we will create the <code>file</code>
            controller and the <code>upload</code> action.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$adapter = new Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http();

$adapter->setDestination('C:\temp');

if (!$adapter->receive()) {
    $messages = $adapter->getMessages();
    echo implode("\n", $messages);
}
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            This code listing demonstrates the simplest usage of
            <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname>. A local destination is set with the
            <code>setDestination</code> method, then the <methodname>receive()</methodname> method
            is called. if there are any upload errors, an error will be returned.
        </para>

    </example>

    <note>
        <title>Attention</title>
        <para>
            This example is suitable only for demonstrating the basic <acronym>API</acronym> of
            <classname>Zend_File_Transfer</classname>. You should <emphasis>never</emphasis> use
            this code listing in a production environment, because severe security issues may be
            introduced. You should always use validators to increase security.

            Second, you need to have the proper hidden fields added in the form which sends the
