    <para>
        <classname>Zend\Log\Logger</classname> is a component for general purpose logging.
        It supports multiple log backends, formatting messages sent to the log,
        and filtering messages from being logged. These functions are divided
        into the following objects:
    </para>
    
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    A Logger (instance of <classname>Zend\Log\Logger</classname>) is the object that your
                    application uses the most. You can have as many Logger objects as you
                    like; they do not interact. A Logger object must contain at
                    least one Writer, and can optionally contain one or more Filters.
                </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    A Writer (inherits from <classname>Zend\Log\Writer\AbstractWriter</classname>) is
                    responsible for saving data to storage.
                </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    A Filter (implements <classname>Zend\Log\Filter</classname>)
                    blocks log data from being saved. A filter may be applied to an
                    individual Writer, or to a Logger where it is applied before all
                    Writers. In either case, filters may be chained.
                </para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    A Formatter (inheriting from <classname>Zend\Log\Formatter\AbstractFormatter</classname>)
                    can format the log data before it is written by a Writer. Each
                    Writer has exactly one Formatter.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

    <section xml:id="zend.log.overview.creating-a-logger"><title>Creating a Log</title>

        <para>
            To get started logging, instantiate a Writer and then pass it to a Logger instance:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$logger = new Zend\Log\Logger;
$writer = new Zend\Log\Writer\Stream('php://output');

$logger->addWriter($writer);
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            It is important to note that the Logger must
            have at least one Writer. You can add any number of Writers using the
            Log's <methodname>addWriter()</methodname> method.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="zend.log.overview.logging-messages"><title>Logging Messages</title>
        

        <para>
            To log a message, call the <methodname>log()</methodname> method of a Log instance
            and pass it the message with a corresponding priority:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$logger->log(Zend\Log\Logger::INFO, 'Informational message');
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The first parameter of the <methodname>log()</methodname> method is an integer
            <property>priority</property> and the second paramter is a string
            <property>message</property> . The priority must be one of the priorities recognized by
            the Logger instance. This is explained in the next section.
        </para>

        <para>
            A shortcut is also available. Instead of calling the <methodname>log()</methodname>
            method, you can call a method by the same name as the priority:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$logger->log(Zend\Log\Logger::INFO, 'Informational message');
$logger->info('Informational message');

$logger->log(Zend\Log\Logger::EMERG, 'Emergency message');
$logger->emerg('Emergency message');
]]></programlisting>

    </section>

    <section xml:id="zend.log.overview.destroying-a-logger"><title>Destroying a Log</title>
        

        <para>
            If the Logger object is no longer needed, set the variable containing it to
            <constant>NULL</constant> to destroy it. This will automatically call the
            <methodname>shutdown()</methodname> instance method of each attached Writer before
            the Log object is destroyed:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$logger = null;
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Explicitly destroying the log in this way is optional and is performed
            automatically at <acronym>PHP</acronym> shutdown.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="zend.log.overview.builtin-priorities"><title>Using Built-in Priorities</title>
        

        <para>
            The <classname>Zend\Log\Logger</classname> class defines the following priorities:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
EMERG   = 0;  // Emergency: system is unusable
ALERT   = 1;  // Alert: action must be taken immediately
CRIT    = 2;  // Critical: critical conditions
ERR     = 3;  // Error: error conditions
WARN    = 4;  // Warning: warning conditions
NOTICE  = 5;  // Notice: normal but significant condition
INFO    = 6;  // Informational: informational messages
DEBUG   = 7;  // Debug: debug messages
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            These priorities are always available, and a convenience method of the same name
            is available for each one.
        </para>

        <para>
            The priorities are not arbitrary. They come from the BSD syslog protocol,
            which is described in <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164">RFC-3164</link>.
            The names and corresponding priority numbers are also
            compatible with another <acronym>PHP</acronym> logging system,
            <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://pear.php.net/package/log">PEAR Log</link>,
            which perhaps promotes interoperability between it and <classname>Zend\Log\Logger</classname>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Priority numbers descend in order of importance. <constant>EMERG</constant> (0)
            is the most important priority. <constant>DEBUG</constant> (7) is the least
            important priority of the built-in priorities. You may define priorities
            of lower importance than <constant>DEBUG</constant>. When
            selecting the priority for your log message, be aware of this priority
            hierarchy and choose appropriately.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="zend.log.overview.understanding-fields"><title>Understanding Log Events</title>
        
        <para>
            When you call the <methodname>log()</methodname> method or one of its shortcuts, a
            log event is created. This is simply an associative array with data
            describing the event that is passed to the writers. The following keys
            are always created in this array: <property>timestamp</property>,
            <property>message</property>, <property>priority</property>, and
            <property>priorityName</property>.
        </para>

        <para>
            The creation of the <property>event</property> array is completely transparent.
        </para>

        <para>
            <classname>Zend\Log\Logger</classname> can also be used to log <acronym>PHP</acronym> errors
            and intercept Exceptions.
            Calling the static method <methodname>registerErrorHandler($logger)</methodname> will add the
            $logger object before the current PHP error handler, 
            and will pass the error along as well.
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
use Zend\Log\Logger;
use Zend\Log\Writer\Stream as StreamWriter;
    
$logger = new Logger;
$writer = new StreamWriter('php://output');
$logger->addWriter($writer);

Logger::registerErrorHandler($this->logger);
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            If you want to unregister the error handler you can use the 
            <methodname>unregisterErrorHandler()</methodname> static method.
