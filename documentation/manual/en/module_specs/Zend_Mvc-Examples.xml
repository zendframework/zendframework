        <para>
            While the <classname>Application</classname> class will actually perform execution of
            the application, you still need to provide some configuration -- for instance, setting
            up the Dependency Injector or Service Locator instance you plan to use, and providing
            routes to the router.
        </para>

        <para>
            The best way to accomplish this is via composition. Consider the following
            <classname>Bootstrap</classname> class. It accepts an <classname>Application</classname>
            instance to its <methodname>bootstrap()</methodname> method and configures it.

            Controllers are simply classes that implement
            <classname>Zend\Stdlib\Dispatchable</classname>. As such, it's up to the developer to
            determine how they handle a request.
        </para>

        <para>
            To hand off the request to the controller requires two wirings:

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    A route that, when matched, returns a controller name.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    A DI manager that composes a definition that includes that controller name, or
                    composes configuration that aliases the controller name to a valid class in the
                    composed DI definition.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
            Let's assume we have a "Hello" controller:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
namespace HelloWorld\Controller;

use Zend\Http\Response as HttpResponse,
    Zend\Stdlib\Dispatchable,
    Zend\Stdlib\RequestDescription as Request,
    Zend\Stdlib\ResponseDescription as Response;

class HelloController implements Dispatchable
{
    public function dispatch(Request $request, Response $response = null)
    {
        if (null === $response) {

        return $response;
    }
}
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Let's now create a route:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
use Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\LiteralRoute;

// Assume this is likely in some bootstrap
$route = new LiteralRoute(array(
    'route'    => '/hello',
    'defaults' => array(
        'controller' => 'controller.hello-world.hello',
    ),
));
$app->getRouter()->addRoute('hello', $route);
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Finally, our DI configuration needs to know about the controller.
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
use Zend\Di\Configuration;

$config = new Configuration(array(
    'di' => array(
        'instance' => array(
            'alias' => array(
                'controller.hello-world.hello' => 'HelloWorld\Controller\HelloController',
            ),
        ),
    ),
));
$config->configure($di); // assuming we've created it previously
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Once these are in place, when navigating to the url "/hello", we'll now execute our
            controller's <methodname>dispatch()</methodname> method.
        </para>

        <para>
            While this approach is portable and allows you to handle any request, we doubt you'll
            want to write <methodname>dispatch()</methodname> logic for each and every controller
            you write, much less each and every action. As such, this module also includes two base
            controllers you can extend, the <classname>ActionController</classname> and the
            <classname>RestfulController</classname>.
        </para>

        <section xml:id="zend.mvc.examples.controllers.action-controller">

            <para>
                <classname>Zend\Mvc\Controller\ActionController</classname> is very similar to
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Action</classname> in the Zend Framework 1.X series. It
                checks for a matched "action" token in the returned array from a router, and then
                maps this to a corresponding "Action" method. As some examples:
            </para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>Action "foo" maps to method "fooAction"</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Action "foo-bar" maps to method "fooBarAction"</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Action "bar.baz" maps to method "barBazAction"</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Action "baz\_.bat" maps to method "bazBatAction"</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>
                As you can see, the simple rule is that "-", ".", and "\_" all become word
                separators, and the individual words are camelCased and appended with the word
                "Action".
            </para>

            <para>
                The "action" token is something your route will discover. For instance given a
                standard route of:
            </para>

            <literallayout>
/:controller/:action
            </literallayout>

            <para>
                and the invoked URL:
            </para>

            <literallayout>
/foo/bar
            </literallayout>

            <para>
                the assumption is that the controller name is "foo" and will map to a
                <classname>Dispatchable</classname> class, and the action name is "bar". These
                values are returned by the router as members of an instance of
                <classname>Zend\Mvc\Router\RouteMatch</classname>. That class allows you to pull
                such members using the method <methodparam>getParam()</methodparam>, which also
                allows you to specify a default value to return if the parameter is not found.
            </para>

            <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$action = $routeMatch->getParam('action', false);
if (!$action) {
    // No action found!
    // ...
}
]]></programlisting>

            <para>
                Two special actions are defined by default, "index" and "not-found". The former is
                used whenever an <classname>ActionControlle</classname>r is invoked without an
                "action" parameter in the route match. The latter is invoked if the discovered
                action does not map to an existing method in the controller. 
            </para>

            <para>
                Normal development using an <classname>ActionController</classname> is very
                straight-forward: you identify needed functionality, and simply create an action
                method for that endpoint. As an example, let's return to the "/foo/bar" URL from
                earlier:
            </para>

            <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
namespace SomeModule\Controller;

use Zend\Mvc\Controller\ActionController;

class FooController extends ActionController
{
    public function barAction()
    {
        // do some stuff
    }
}
]]></programlisting>

            <para>
                It is up to you as a developer what you will return from an action method. We
                suggest returning either an associative array, or a value object of some kind.  This
                can then easily be passed to some sort of renderer during the execution chain in
                order to generate a response payload.
            </para>

            <para>
                Alternately, you could return a response object from your method. This allows you to
                essentially return as early as possible from execution.

            <para>
                <classname>Zend\Mvc\Controller\RestfulController</classname> is a somewhat naive
                interpretation of the REST paradigm. It operates primarily as a CRUD
                (Create-Read-Update-Delete)-style controller, but uses HTTP verbs in order to
                determine what to do.

                        POST creates a new resource. Ideally, you will return it, as well as a
                        Location header indicating the new URI to the resource, and a 201 HTTP
                        response code.

                    <para>
                        PUT requires an identifier, and uses the data provided to update the
                        specified resource, assuming it exists.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        DELETE requires an identifier, and should delete the given resource;
                        typically, a 204 response code should be returned.

            </itemizedlist>

            <para>
                Additionally, you can define "action" methods like you would with a standard
                <classname>ActionController</classname>. If an "action" token is found in the route
                match, it will look for a matching action method and execute it, or a "not-found"
                action if no match exists.
