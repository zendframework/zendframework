        REST Web Services use service-specific XML formats. These ad-hoc
        standards mean that the manner for accessing a REST web service is
        different for each service. REST web services typically use URL
        parameters (GET data) or path information for requesting data and POST
        data for sending data.

        Zend Framework provides both Client and Server capabilities, which,
        when used together allow for a much more "local" interface experience
        via virtual object property access. The Server component features
        automatic exposition of functions and classes using a meaningful and
        simple XML format. When accessing these services using the Client, it is
        possible to easily retrieve the return data from the remote call. Should
        you wish to use the client with a non-Zend_Rest_Server based service, it
        will still provide easier data access.
