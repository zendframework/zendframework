        <para>
            <classname>Zend_Tool_Framework</classname> is a framework for exposing common
            functionalities such as the creation of project scaffolds, code
            generation, search index generation, and much more. Functionality may be
            written and exposed via <acronym>PHP</acronym> classes dropped into the
            <acronym>PHP</acronym> <property>include_path</property>, providing incredible
            flexibility of implementation. The functionality may then be consumed by writing
            implementation and/or protocol-specific clients -- such as console
            clients, <acronym>XML-RPC</acronym>, <acronym>SOAP</acronym>, and much more.

            <classname>Zend_Tool_Project</classname> builds on and extends the capabilities of
            <classname>Zend_Tool_Framework</classname> to that of managing a "project". In general,
            a "project" is a planned endeavor or an initiative. In the computer world, projects
            generally are a collection of resources. These resources can be files, directories,
            databases, schemas, images, styles, and more.

            <para>
                The <acronym>CLI</acronym>, or command line tool (internally known as the console
                tool), is currently the primary interface for dispatching
                <classname>Zend_Tool</classname> requests. With the <acronym>CLI</acronym> tool,
                developers can issue tooling requests inside the "command line windows", also
                commonly known as a "terminal" window. This environment is predominant in the *nix
                environment, but also has a common implementation in windows with the
                <filename>cmd.exe</filename>, console2 and also with the Cygwin project.
            </para>

            <section xml:id="zend.tool.extending.zend-tool-framework.cli-client.setup-general"><info><title>Setting up the CLI tool</title></info>
                

                <para>
                    To issue tooling requests via the command line client, you first
                    need to set up the client so that your system can handle the "zf"
                    command. The command line client, for all intents and purposes, is
                    the <filename>.sh</filename> or <filename>.bat</filename> file that is provided
                    with your Zend Framework distribution. In trunk, it can be found here:
                    <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/bin/">http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/bin/</link>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As you can see, there are 3 files in the <filename>/bin/</filename>
                    directory: a <filename>zf.php</filename>, <filename>zf.sh</filename>, and
                    <filename>zf.bat</filename>. The <filename>zf.sh</filename> and the
                    <filename>zf.bat</filename> are the operating system specific client
                    wrappers: <filename>zf.sh</filename> for the *nix environment, and
                    <filename>zf.bat</filename> for the Win32 environment. These client wrappers are
                    responsible for finding the proper <filename>php.exe</filename>, finding the
                    <filename>zf.php</filename>, and passing on the client request. The
                    <filename>zf.php</filename> is the responsible for handling understanding
                    your environment, constructing the proper include_path, and passing
                    what is provided on the command line to the proper library component
                    for dispatching.
                </para>

                    Ultimately, you want to ensure two things to make everything work
                    regardless of the operating system you are on:

                            <filename>zf.sh/zf.bat</filename> is reachable from your system
                            path. This is the ability to call <command>zf</command> from
                            anywhere on your command line, regardless of what your
                            current working directory is.

                        Note: while the above are the most ideal
                        requirements, you can simply download Zend Framework and expect it
                        to work as <filename>./path/to/zf.php</filename> some command.

                <para>
                    The most common setup in the *nix environment, is to copy the
                    <filename>zf.sh</filename> and <filename>zf.php</filename> into the same
                    directory as your <acronym>PHP</acronym> binary. This can generally be found in
                    one of the following places:
                </para>

                <para>
                    To find out the location of your <acronym>PHP</acronym> binary, you can execute
                    'which php' on the command line. This will return the location of the
                    <acronym>PHP</acronym> binary you will be using to run <acronym>PHP</acronym>
                    scripts in this environment.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The next order of business is to ensure that Zend Framework
                    library is set up correctly inside of the system <acronym>PHP</acronym>
                    <property>include_path</property>. To find out where your
                    <property>include_path</property> is located, you can execute
                    <command>php -i</command> and look for the <property>include_path</property>
                    variable, or more succinctly, execute
                    <command>php -i | grep include_path</command>. Once you have found where
                    your <property>include_path</property> is located (this will generally be
                    something like <filename>/usr/lib/php</filename>,
                    <filename>/usr/share/php</filename>, <filename>/usr/local/lib/php</filename>, or
                    similar), ensure that the contents of the <filename>/library/</filename>
                    directory are put inside your <property>include_path</property> specified
                    directory.

                <para>
                    Once you have done those two things, you should be able to issue a
                    command and get back the proper response like this:

                <para>
                    If you do not see this type of output, go back and check your setup
                    to ensure you have all of the necessary pieces in the proper place.
                </para>

                <para>
                    There are a couple of alternative setups you might want to employ
                    depending on your servers configuration, your level of access, or
                    for other reasons.

                <para>
                    <emphasis>Alternative Setup</emphasis> involves keeping the Zend

                    <constant>PATH</constant> location to the <filename>zf.sh</filename>. What this
                    means is you can place the contents of the ZendFramework download into a
                    location such as <filename>/usr/local/share/ZendFramework</filename>, or more
                    locally like <filename>/home/username/lib/ZendFramework</filename>, and creating

                    Assuming you want to put the link inside <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>
                    (this could also work for placing the link inside
                    <filename>/home/username/bin/</filename> for example) you would issue a

]]></programlisting>

                <para>
                    This will create a link which you should be able to access globally
                    on the command line.

                    <command>php -i</command> and look for the <property>include_path</property>
                    variable, or more succinctly execute
                    <command>php -i | grep include_path</command> if you have Cygwin setup with
                    grep available. Once you have found where your
                    <property>include_path</property> is located (this will generally be
                    something like <filename>C:\PHP\pear</filename>,

                In general, a provider, on its own, is nothing more than the shell for a
                developer to bundle up some capabilities they wish to dispatch with the
                command line (or other) clients. It is an analogue to what a

                    By default <classname>Zend_Tool</classname> uses the BasicLoader to find all
                    the providers that you can run. It recursivly iterates all
                    include path directories and opens all files that end
                    with "Manifest.php" or "Provider.php". All classes in these
                    files are inspected if they implement either
                    <classname>Zend_Tool_Framework_Provider_Interface</classname>
                    or <classname>Zend_Tool_Framework_Manifest_ProviderManifestable</classname>.
                    Instances of the provider interface make up for the real functionality
                    and all their public methods are accessible as provider actions.
                    The ProviderManifestable interface however requires the implementation of a
                    method <methodname>getProviders()</methodname> which returns an array of
                    instantiated provider interface instances.

                    As an example, if a developer wants to add the capability of showing

                    Assuming the component is called <classname>My_Component</classname>, he would
                    create a class named <classname>My_Component_HelloProvider</classname> in a

                    <para>
                        The above "Hello World" example is great for simple commands, but
                        what about something more advanced? As your scripting and tooling
                        needs grow, you might find that you need the ability to accept
                        variables. Much like function signatures have parameters, your
                        tooling requests can also accept parameters.

                    <para>
                        Just as each tooling request can be isolated to a method within a
                        class, the parameters of a tooling request can also be isolated in a
                        very well known place. Parameters of the action methods of a
                        provider can include the same parameters you want your client to
                        utilize when calling that provider and action combination. For
                        example, if you wanted to accept a name in the above example, you
                        would probably do this in OO code:

                        as a parameter of the method call. Also note, as you see that the
                        parameter is optional, that means it is also optional on the command
                        line, so that <command>zf say hello</command> will still work, and default
                        to the name "Ralph".

                    <para>
                        Another interesting feature you might wish to implement is
                        <emphasis>pretendability</emphasis>. Pretendabilty is the ability
                        for your provider to "pretend" as if it is doing the requested
                        action and provider combination and give the user as much
                        information about what it <emphasis>would</emphasis> do without
                        actually doing it. This might be an important notion when doing
                        heavy database or filesystem modifications that the user might not
                        otherwise want to do.

                    <para>
                        Pretendability is easy to implement. There are two parts to this
                        feature: 1) marking the provider as having the ability to "pretend",
                        and 2) checking the request to ensure the current request was indeed
                        asked to be "pretended". This feature is demonstrated in the code
                        sample below.

                            When designing your providers that are config or storage aware remember
                            to check if the required user-config or storage keys really exist for a
                            user. You won't run into fatal errors when none of these are provided
                            though, since empty ones are created upon request.

        <para>
            <classname>Zend_Tool_Project</classname> exposes a rich set of functionality and
            capabilities that make the task of creating new providers, specficially those targetting
            project easier and more manageable.

                This same concept applies to Zend Framework projects. In Zend Framework projects,
                you have controllers, actions, views, models, databases and so on and so forth. In
                terms of <classname>Zend_Tool</classname>, we need a way to track these types of
                resources - thus <classname>Zend_Tool_Project</classname>.
            </para>

            <para>
                <classname>Zend_Tool_Project</classname> is capable of tracking project resources
                throughout the development of a project. So, for example, if in one command you
                created a controller, and in the next command you wish to create an action within
                that controller, <classname>Zend_Tool_Project</classname> is gonna have to
                <emphasis>know</emphasis> about the controller file you created so that you can (in
                the next action), be able to append that action to it. This is what keeps our
                projects up to date and <emphasis>stateful</emphasis>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Another important point to understand about projects is that typically, resources
                are organized in a hierarchical fashion. With that in mind,
                <classname>Zend_Tool_Project</classname> is capable of serializing the current
                project into a internal representation that allows it to keep track of not only
                <emphasis>what</emphasis> resources are part of a project at any given time, but
                also <emphasis>where</emphasis> they are in relation to one another.

            <para>
                Project specific providers are created in the same fashion as plain framework
                providers, with one exception: project providers must extend the
                <classname>Zend_Tool_Project_Provider_Abstract</classname>. This class comes with
                some significant functionality that helps developers load existing project, obtian
                the profile object, and be able to search the profile, then later store any changes
                to the current project profile.
