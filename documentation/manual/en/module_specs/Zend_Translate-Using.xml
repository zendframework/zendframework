    <title>Using Translation Adapters</title>

    <para>
        The next step is to use the adapter within your code.
    </para>

    <example id="zend.translate.using.example1">
        <title>Example of single-language PHP code</title>
        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
print "Example\n";
print "=======\n";
print "Here is line one\n";
print "Today is the " . date("d.m.Y") . "\n";
print "\n";
print "Here is line two\n";
]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
        The example above shows some output with no support for translation.
        You probably write your code in your native language.
        Generally you need to translate not only the output,
        but also error and log messages.
    </para>

    <para>
        The next step is to integrate Zend Translate into your existing code.
        Of course it is much easier if you had already written your code with
        translation in mind, than changing your code afterwards.
    </para>

    <example id="zend.translate.using.example2">
        <title>Example of multi-lingual PHP code</title>
        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$translate = new Zend_Translate('gettext', '/my/path/source-de.mo', 'de');
$translate->addTranslation('/path/to/translation/fr-source.mo', 'fr');

print $translate->_("Example") . "\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_("Here is line one") . "\n";
printf($translate->_("Today is the %1\$s") . "\n", date('d.m.Y'));
print "\n";

$translate->setLocale('fr');
print $translate->_("Here is line two") . "\n";
]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
        Now let's take a deeper look into what has been done and how to
        integrate <classname>Zend_Translate</classname> into your own code.
    </para>

    <para>
        Create a new <classname>Zend_Translate</classname> object and define the base adapter:

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$translate = new Zend_Translate
    'gettext',
    '/path/to/translation/source-de.mo',
    'de'
);
]]></programlisting>

        In this example we chose the
        <emphasis>Gettext Adapter</emphasis>.
        We place our file <emphasis>source-de.mo</emphasis>
        into the directory <emphasis>/path/to/translation</emphasis>.
        The gettext file will have German translation included,
        and we also added another language source for French.
    </para>

    <para>
        The next step is to wrap all strings which are to be translated.
        The simplest approach is to have only simple strings or sentences
        like this:

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
print $translate->_("Example") . "\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_("Here is line one") . "\n";
]]></programlisting>

        Some strings do not needed to be translated.
        The separating line is always a separating line,
        even in other languages.
    </para>

    <para>
        Having data values integrated into a translation string is also
        supported through the use of embedded parameters.

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
printf($translate->_("Today is the %1\$s") . "\n", date("d.m.Y"));
]]></programlisting>

        Instead of <code>print()</code>, use the <code>printf()</code>
        function and replace all parameters with <code>%1\$s</code> parts.
        The first is <code>%1\$s</code>, the second is <code>%2\$s</code>,
        and so on. This way a translation can be done without knowing
        the exact value. In our example, the date is always the actual day,
        but the string can be translated without the knowledge of the actual
        day.
    </para>

    <para>
        Each string is identified in the translation storage by a message ID.
        You can use message IDs instead of strings in your code, like this:

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
print $translate->_(1) . "\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_(2) . "\n";
]]></programlisting>

        But doing this has several disadvantages:
    </para>

    <para>
        You can not see what your code should output just by viewing your code.
    </para>

    <para>
        Also you will have problems if some strings are not translated.
        You must always keep in mind how translation works.
        First <classname>Zend_Translate</classname> checks whether the specified language has a translation
        for the given message ID or string.
        If no translation string has been found it refers to the next lower
        level language as defined within <classname>Zend_Locale</classname>.
        So "<emphasis>de_AT</emphasis>" becomes
        "<emphasis>de</emphasis>" only.
        If there is no translation found for
        "<emphasis>de</emphasis>" either,
        then the original message is returned.
        This way you always have an output, even in case the message translation
        does not exist in your message storage.
        <classname>Zend_Translate</classname> never throws an error or exception when translating
        strings.
    </para>

        <title>Translation Source Structures</title>

        <para>
            Your next step is to create the translation sources for the
            languages you want to translate.
            Every adapter is created its own way as described here,
            but there are common features applicable for all adapters.
        </para>

        <para>
            You have to decide where to store your translation source files.
            Using <classname>Zend_Translate</classname> you are not restricted in any way.

        <title>Creating Array source files</title>

        <para>
            Array source files are plain arrays. But you have to define them
            manually since there is no tool to aid this.
            But because they are so simple, it's the fastest way to look up
            messages if your code works as expected. It's generally the best
            adapter to get started with translation business.
        </para>

    'message1' => 'message1',

$translate->addTranslation($deutsch, 'de');
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Since release 1.5 it is also supported to have arrays included within an external file.
            You just have to provide the filename and <classname>Zend_Translate</classname> will automatically
            include it and look for the array. See the following example for details:

        <title>Creating Gettext source files</title>

        <para>
            Gettext source files are created by GNU's gettext library.
            There are several free tools available that can parse your
            code files and create the needed gettext source files.
            These have the extension <emphasis>*.mo</emphasis>
            and they are binary files.
            An open source tool for creating the files is
            <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/">poEdit</ulink>.
            This tool also supports you during the translation process itself.

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
// We accume that we have created the mo files and translated them
$translate = new Zend_Translate('gettext', '/path/to/english.mo', 'en');
$translate->addTranslation('/path/to/german.mo', 'de');
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            As you can see the adapters are used exactly the same way,
            with one small difference:
            change <emphasis>array</emphasis> to <emphasis>gettext</emphasis>. All other usages are exactly
            the same as with all other adapters.
            With the gettext adapter you no longer have to be aware of
            gettext's standard directory structure,
            bindtextdomain and textdomain.
            Just give the path and filename to the adapter.
        </para>

        <note>
            <para>
                 You should always use UTF-8 as source encoding.
                 Otherwise you will have problems when using two
                 different source encodings.
                 E.g. one of your source files is encoded
                 with ISO-8815-11 and another one with CP815.
                 You can set only one encoding for your source file,
                 so one of your languages probably will not display correctly.
            </para>
            <para>
                 UTF-8 is a portable format which supports all languages.
                 When using UTF-8 for all languages, you will eliminate
                 the problem of incompatible encodings.
            </para>
        </note>

        <para>
            Many gettext editors add adapter informations as empty translation string.
            This is the reason why empty strings are not translated when using the
            gettext adapter. Instead they are erased from the translation table and
            provided by the <code>getAdapterInfo()</code> method. It will return
            the adapter informations for all added gettext files as array using the
            filename as key.

            INI files have several restrictions. If a value in the ini file contains any
            non-alphanumeric characters it needs to be enclosed in double-quotes (<code>"</code>).
            There are also reserved words which must not be used as keys for ini files.
            These include: <constant>NULL</constant>, <code>yes</code>, <code>no</code>, <constant>TRUE</constant>,
            and <constant>FALSE</constant>. Values <constant>NULL</constant>, <code>no</code> and <constant>FALSE</constant> results
            in <code>""</code>, <code>yes</code> and <constant>TRUE</constant> results in <code>1</code>. Characters <code>{}|&amp;~![()"</code> must not be used anywhere
            in the key and have a special meaning in the value. Do not use them as it will
            produce unexpected behaviour.

        <para>
            Options can be used with all adapters. Of course the options are different for all adapters.
            You can set options when you create the adapter. Actually there is one option which is available
            to all adapters: '<code>clear</code>' sets if translation data should be added to existing
            one or not. Standard behaviour is to add new translation data to existing one. But the
            translation data is only cleared for the selected language. So other languages remain
            untouched.
        </para>

        <para>
            You can set options temporarily when using <code>addTranslation($data, $locale, array $options = array())</code>
            as third and optional parameter. And you can use the method <code>setOptions()</code> to
            set the options permanently.

        <para>
            When you want to have self defined options, you are also able to use them within all adapters.
            The <code>setOptions()</code> method can be used to define your option. <code>setOptions()</code>
            needs an array with the options you want to set. If an given option exists it will be signed over.
            You can define as much options as needed as they will not be checked by the adapter. Just make sure
            not to overwrite any existing option which is used by an adapter.
        </para>

        <para>
            To return the option you can use the <code>getOptions()</code> method. When <code>getOptions()</code>
            is called without a parameter it will return all options set. When the optional parameter is given
            you will only get the specified option.

        <title>Handling languages</title>

        <para>
            When working with different languages there are a few methods which will be useful.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>getLocale()</code> method can be used to get the currently set language. It can either hold
            an instance of <classname>Zend_Locale</classname> or the identifier of a locale.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>setLocale()</code> method sets a new standard language for translation. This prevents the
            need of setting the optional language parameter more than once to the <code>translate()</code> method.
            If the given language does not exist, or no translation data is available for the language,
            <code>setLocale()</code> tries to downgrade to the language without the region if any was given.
            A language of <code>en_US</code> would be downgraded to <code>en</code>. When even the downgraded
            language can not be found an exception will be thrown.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>isAvailable()</code> method checks if a given language is already available. It returns
            <constant>TRUE</constant> if data for the given language exist.
        </para>

        <para>
            And finally the <code>getList()</code> method can be used to get all currently set languages for an adapter
            returned as array.

                    You should be aware if you have several subdirectories under the same
                    structure. Assuming we have a structure like
                    <code>/language/module/de/en/file.mo</code>. In this case the path contains
                    multiple strings which would be detected as locale. It could be either
                    <code>de</code> or <code>en</code>. In such a case the behaviour is
                    undefined and it is recommended to use file detection in such situations.

            <para>
                Another way to detect the language automatically is to use special filenames. You can either
                name the complete file or parts of a file after the used language. To use this way of detection
                you will have to set the '<code>scan</code>' option at initiation. There are several ways of naming the
                sourcefiles which are described below:

                    <classname>Zend_Translate</classname> is also capable of detecting the language if it is included within the
                    filename. But if you go this way you will have to separate the language with a token.
                    There are three supported tokens which can be used: a dot '.', an underscore '_', or
                    a hyphen '-'.

            Normally text will be translated without any computation. But sometimes it is necessary to

            method can be used.

            <code>isTranslated($messageId, $original = false, $locale = null)</code> takes
            the text you want to check as its first parameter, and as optional third parameter the locale
            for which you want to do the check. The optional second parameter declares whether translation
            is fixed to the declared language or a lower set of translations can be used. If you have a text which
            can be returned for 'en' but not for 'en_US' you will normally get the translation returned, but by
            setting <code>$original</code> to true, <code>isTranslated()</code> will return false.

            You have to follow two or three simple steps. First, you have to create an instance of

            See the following example:

                You should note that any translation which can not be found will be logged. This means
                all translations when a user requests a language which is not supported. Also every request
                for a message which can not be translated will be logged. Be aware, that 100 people
                requesting the same translation, will result 100 logged notices.

        <para>
            This feature can not only be used to log messages but also to attach this untranslated messages
            into an empty translation file. To do so you will have to write your own log writer which
            writes the format you want to have and strips the prepending "Untranslated message".

            You can also set the '<code>logMessage</code>' option when you want to have your own log message.
            Use the '<code>%message%</code>' token for placing the messageId within your log message, and the
            '<code>%locale%</code>' token for the requested locale. See the following example for a self

        </para>

        <para>
            The <code>getMessageIds($locale = null)</code> method returns all known message IDs as array.

            The <code>getMessages($locale = null)</code> method returns the complete translation source as
            an array. The message ID is used as key and the translation data as value.
        </para>

        <para>
            Both methods accept an optional parameter <code>$locale</code> which, if set, returns the
            translation data for the specified language. If this parameter is not given, the actual set
            language will be used. Keep in mind that normally all translations should be available in all
            languages. Which means that in a normal situation you will not have to set this parameter.
        </para>

        <para>
            Additionally the <code>getMessages()</code> method can be used to return the complete
            translation dictionary using the pseudo-locale 'all'. This will return all available
            translation data for each added locale.
