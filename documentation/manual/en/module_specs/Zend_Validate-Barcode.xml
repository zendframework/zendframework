    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Validate_Barcode</classname> allows you to check if a given value can be
        represented as barcode.
    </para>

    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Validate_Barcode</classname> supports multiple barcode standards and can be
        extended with proprietary barcode implementations very easily. The following barcode
        standards are supported:

            <para>
                This barcode has no length limitation, but it must contain an even amount of
                characters. It supports only digits, and the last digit can be an optional checksum
                which is calculated with modulo 10. This standard is used worldwide and common on
                the market.

            </para>

            <para>
                This barcode has a variable length. It supports digits, alphabetical characters
                and 7 special characters. It can have an optional checksum which is calculated with
                modulo 43. This standard is used worldwide and common within the industry.

                This barcode has a variable length. It supports digits, alphabetical characters
                and 7 special characters. It has an checksum which is calculated with modulo 47 and
                contains 2 characters. This standard produces a denser code than CODE39 and is more
                secure.

                be printed.

        <title>Basic usage</title>

        <para>
            To validate if a given string is a barcode you just need to know its type.  See the
            following example for an EAN13 barcode:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$valid = new Zend_Validate_Barcode('EAN13');
if ($valid->isValid($input)) {
    // input appears to be valid
} else {
    // input is invalid
}
]]></programlisting>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="zend.validate.set.barcode.checksum">
        <title>Optional checksum</title>

        <para>
            Some barcodes can be provided with an optional checksum. These barcodes would be valid
            even without checksum. Still, when you provide a checksum, then you should also validate
            it. By default, these barcode types perform no checksum validation. By using the
            <property>checksum</property> option you can define if the checksum will be validated or
            ignored.
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$valid = new Zend_Validate_Barcode(array(
    'adapter'  => 'EAN13',
    'checksum' => false,
));
if ($valid->isValid($input)) {
    // input appears to be valid
} else {
    // input is invalid
}
]]></programlisting>

        <note>
            <title>Reduced security by disabling checksum validation</title>

            <para>
                 By switching off checksum validation you will also reduce the security of the used
                 barcodes. Additionally you should note that you can also turn off the checksum
                 validation for those barcode types which must contain a checksum value. Barcodes
                 which would not be valid could then be returned as valid even if they are not.
