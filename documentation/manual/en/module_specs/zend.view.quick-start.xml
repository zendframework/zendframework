            <classname>Zend\View</classname> provides the "View" layer of Zend
            Framework's MVC system. It is a multi-tiered system allowing a
            variety of mechanisms for extension, substitution, and more.
        </para>

        <para>
            The components of the view layer are as follows:

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <emphasis>Variables containers</emphasis>, which hold
                    variables and callbacks that you wish to represent in the
                    view. Often-times, a Variables container will also provide
                    mechanisms for context-specific escaping of variables and
                    more.
                </para>

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <emphasis>View Models</emphasis>, which hold Variables
                    containers, specify the template to use, if any, and
                    optionally provide rendering options (more on that below).
                    View Models may be nested in order to represent complex
                    structures.

                <para>
                    <emphasis>Renderers</emphasis>, which take View Models and
                    provide a representation of them to return. Zend Framework
                    ships three renderers by default: a "PHP" renderer which
                    utilizes PHP templates in order to generate markup; a JSON
                    renderer; and a Feed renderer, capable of generating RSS and
                    Atom feeds.

                <para>
                    <emphasis>Resolvers</emphasis>, which resolve a template
                    name to a resource a Renderer may consume. As an example, a
                    resolver may take the name "blog/entry" and resolve it to a
                    PHP view script.

                <para>
                    <emphasis>The View</emphasis>, which consists of strategies
                    that map the current Request to a Renderer, and strategies
                    for injecting the Response with the result of rendering.

                <para>
                    <emphasis>Renderer and Response Strategies</emphasis>.
                    Renderer Strategies listen to the "renderer" event of the
                    View, and decide which Renderer should be selected, based on
                    the Request or other criteria. Response strategies are used
                    to inject the Response object with the results of rendering
                    -- which may also include taking actions such as setting
                    Content-Type headers.

            Additionally, Zend Framework provides integration with the MVC via a

        <para>
            This manual section is designed to show you typical usage patterns
            of the view layer when using it within the Zend Framework MVC. The
            assumptions are that you are using <link
                linkend="zend.di">Dependency Injection</link>, and that you are
            using the default <link linkend="zend.mvc.view">default MVC view
                strategies</link>.

            <para>
                The default configuration for the framework will typically work
                out-of-the-box. However, you will still need to select resolver
                strategies and configure them, as well as potentially indicate
                alternate template names for things like the site layout, 404
                (not found) pages, and error pages. The code snippets below can
                be added to your configuration to accomplish this. We recommend
                adding it to a site-specific module, such as the "Application"
                module from the framework's "ZendSkeletonApplication", or to one
                of your autoloaded configurations within the
                <filename>config/autoload/</filename> directory.

            <para>
                Considering that in most cases, you'll likely have a template

                some variables, could this be made simpler? Definitely.
            </para>

            <para>
                The MVC registers a couple of listeners for controllers to
                automate this. The first will look to see if you returned an
                associative array from your controller; if so, it will create a
                view model and inject this associative array as the view
                variables container; this view model then replaces the MVC
                event's result.

            <para>
                The second listener checks to see if the MVC event result is a
                view model, and, if so, if it has a template associated with it.
                If not, it will inspect the controller matched during routing,
                and, if available, it's "action" parameter in order to create a
                template name. This will be "controller/action", with the
                controller and action normalized to lowercase, dash-separated
                words.
            </para>

            <para>
                As an example, the controller
                <classname>Bar\Controller\BazBatController</classname>, with
                action "doSomethingCrazy", would be mapped to the template
                <filename>baz-bat/do-something-crazy</filename>.
            </para>

            <para>
                In practice, that means our previous example could be re-written

                The above method will likely work for a majority of use cases.
                When you need to specify a different template, explicitly create
                and return a view model, and specify the template manually.

            <para>
                The other use case you may have for explicit view models is if

            </para>

            <para>
                As an example, you may want the view from the action to be one

                sidebars; one of the sidebars may include content from multiple

                As you can see, you can achieve very complex markup using nested
                views, while simultaneously keeping the details of rendering
                isolated from the request/reponse lifecycle of the controller.

                Most sites enforce a cohesive look-and-feel, which we typically
                call the site "layout". The site layout includes the default
                stylesheets and JavaScript necessary, if any, as well as the
                basic markup structure into which all site content will be
                injected.

            <para>
                Within Zend Framework, layouts are handled via nesting of view
                models (see the <link
                    linkend="zend.view.quick-start.usage.controllers">previous
                    example</link> for examples of view model nesting). The MVC
                event composes a View Model which acts as the "root" for nested
                view models, as such, it should contain the skeleton, or layout,
                template for the site (configuration refers to this as the
                "layoutTemplate"). All other content is then rendered and
                captured to view variables ov this root view model.

            <para>
                The default rendering strategy sets the layout template as

                There will be times you don't want to render a layout. For
                example, you might be answering an API call which expects JSON
                or an XML payload, or you might be answering an XHR request that
                expects a partial HTML payload. The simplest way to do this is
                to explicitly create and return a view model from your
                controller, and mark it as "terminal", which will hint to the
                MVC listener that normally injects the returned view model into
                the layout view model to instead replace the layout view model.

                done by using the "layout" controller plugin, which returns the

                What if you want to use a custom renderer? or if your app might
                allow a combination of JSON, Atom feeds, and HTML? At this
                point, you'll need to create your own custom strategies. Below
                is an example that more appropriately loops through the HTTP
                Accept header, and selects the appropriate renderer based on
                what is matched first.

                This strategy would be registered just as we demonstrated
                registering the <classname>JsonStrategy</classname> earlier. You
                would also need to define DI configuration to ensure the various
                renderers are injected when you retrieve the strategy from the
                application's locator instance.
