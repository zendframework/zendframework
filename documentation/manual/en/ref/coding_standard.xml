                This document provides guidelines for code formatting and documentation to
                individuals and teams contributing to Zend Framework. Many developers using Zend
                Framework have also found these coding standards useful because their code's style
                remains consistent with all Zend Framework code. It is also worth noting that it
                requires significant effort to fully specify coding standards.

                    Note: Sometimes developers consider the establishment of a standard more
                    important than what that standard actually suggests at the most detailed level
                    of design. The guidelines in the Zend Framework coding standards capture
                    practices that have worked well on the ZF project. You may modify these
                    standards or use them as is in accordance with the terms of our <ulink

                Coding standards are important in any development project, but they are particularly
                important when many developers are working on the same project. Coding standards
                help ensure that the code is high quality, has fewer bugs, and can be easily
                maintained.

                The target line length is 80 characters. That is to say, ZF developers should strive

                However, longer lines are acceptable in some circumstances. The maximum length of

            <para>
                Zend Framework standardizes on a class naming convention whereby the names of the
                classes directly map to the directories in which they are stored. The root level
                directory of the ZF standard library is the "Zend/" directory, whereas
                the root level directory of the ZF extras library is the "ZendX/" directory. All
                Zend Framework classes are stored hierarchically under these root directories..
            </para>

            <para>
                Class names may only contain alphanumeric characters. Numbers are permitted
                in class names but are discouraged in most cases. Underscores are only permitted in
                place of the path separator; the filename "<filename>Zend/Db/Table.php</filename>"
                must map to the class name "<classname>Zend_Db_Table</classname>".
            </para>

            <para>
                If a class name is comprised of more than one word, the first letter of each new
                word must be capitalized. Successive capitalized letters are not allowed, e.g.
                a class "Zend_PDF" is not allowed while "<classname>Zend_Pdf</classname>" is
                acceptable.
            </para>

            <para>
                These conventions define a pseudo-namespace mechanism for Zend Framework. Zend
                Framework will adopt the <acronym>PHP</acronym> namespace feature when it becomes
                available and is feasible for our developers to use in their applications.
            </para>

            <para>
                See the class names in the standard and extras libraries for examples of this
                classname convention.

                    <emphasis>Important</emphasis>: Code that must be deployed alongside
                    ZF libraries but is not part of the standard or extras libraries (e.g.
                    application code or libraries that are not distributed by Zend) must never
                    start with "Zend_" or "ZendX_".

        <sect2 id="coding-standard.naming-conventions.abstracts">
            <title>Abstract Classes</title>

            <para>
                In general, abstract classes follow the same conventions as <link
                    linkend="coding-standard.naming-conventions.classes">classes</link>,
                with one additional rule: abstract class names must end in the term, "Abstract",
                and that term must not be preceded by an underscore. As an example,
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract</classname> is considered an
                invalid name, but <classname>Zend_Controller_PluginAbstract</classname> or
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_PluginAbstract</classname> would be valid
                names.
            </para>

            <note>
                <para>
                    This naming convention is new with version 1.9.0 of Zend Framework. Classes
                    that pre-date that version may not follow this rule, but will be renamed in
                    the future in order to comply.

        <sect2 id="coding-standard.naming-conventions.interfaces">
            <title>Interfaces</title>

            <para>
                In general, interfaces follow the same conventions as <link
                    linkend="coding-standard.naming-conventions.classes">classes</link>,
                with one additional rule: interface names may optionally end in the term,
                "Interface", but that term must not be preceded by an underscore. As an example,
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_Interface</classname> is considered an
                invalid name, but <classname>Zend_Controller_PluginInterface</classname> or
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_PluginInterface</classname> would be valid
                names.
            </para>

            <para>
                While this rule is not required, it is strongly recommended, as it provides a
                good visual cue to developers as to which files contain interfaces rather than
                classes.
            </para>

                For all other files, only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and the dash
                character ("-") are permitted. Spaces are strictly prohibited.
            </para>

            <para>
                Any file that contains <acronym>PHP</acronym> code should end with the extension
                "<filename>.php</filename>", with the notable exception of view scripts. The
                following examples show acceptable filenames for Zend Framework classes:

            <title>Functions and Methods</title>

            <para>
                Function names may only contain alphanumeric characters. Underscores are not
                permitted. Numbers are permitted in function names but are discouraged in most
                cases.
            </para>

            <para>
                Function names must always start with a lowercase letter. When a function name
                consists of more than one word, the first letter of each new word must be
                capitalized. This is commonly called "camelCase" formatting.
            </para>

            <para>
                Verbosity is generally encouraged. Function names should be as verbose as is
                practical to fully describe their purpose and behavior.
            </para>

            <para>
                These are examples of acceptable names for functions:

            <para>
                For object-oriented programming, accessors for instance or static variables should
                always be prefixed with "get" or "set". In implementing design patterns, such as the
                singleton or factory patterns, the name of the method should contain the pattern
                name where practical to more thoroughly describe behavior.
            </para>

            <para>
                For methods on objects that are declared with the "private" or "protected" modifier,
                the first character of the method name must be an underscore. This is the only
                acceptable application of an underscore in a method name. Methods declared "public"
                should never contain an underscore.
            </para>

            <para>
                Functions in the global scope (a.k.a "floating functions") are permitted but
                discouraged in most cases. Consider wrapping these functions in a static class.

                For instance variables that are declared with the "private" or "protected" modifier,
                the first character of the variable name must be a single underscore. This is the
                only acceptable application of an underscore in a variable name. Member variables
                declared "public" should never start with an underscore.
            </para>

            <para>
                As with function names (see section 3.3) variable names must always start with a
                lowercase letter and follow the "camelCaps" capitalization convention.
            </para>

            <para>
                Verbosity is generally encouraged. Variables should always be as verbose as
                practical to describe the data that the developer intends to store in them. Terse
                variable names such as "$i" and "$n" are discouraged for all but the smallest loop
                contexts. If a loop contains more than 20 lines of code, the index variables should
                have more descriptive names.

            </para>

            <para>
                All letters used in a constant name must be capitalized, while all words in a

            <para>
                Constants must be defined as class members with the "const" modifier. Defining

                    For "if" statements that include "elseif" or "else", the formatting conventions
                    are similar to the "if" construct. The following examples demonstrate proper
                    formatting for "if" statements with "else" and/or "elseif" constructs:

                        including a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> within that case. To
                        distinguish these cases from bugs, any <code>case</code> statement where
                        <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> are omitted should contain a
                        comment indicating that the break was intentionally omitted.
