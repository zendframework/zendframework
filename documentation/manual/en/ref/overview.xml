        Zend Framework (ZF) is an open source framework for developing web
        applications and services with PHP 5. ZF is implemented using 100% object-oriented
        code. The component structure of ZF is somewhat unique; each component is designed
        with few dependencies on other components. This loosely coupled architecture allows
        developers to use components individually. We often call this a "use-at-will" design.

        While they can be used separately, Zend Framework components in the standard library
        form a powerful and extensible web application framework when combined. ZF offers a
        robust, high performance MVC implementation, a database abstraction that is simple to
        use, and a forms component that implements HTML form rendering, validation, and filtering
        so that developers can consolidate all of these operations using one easy-to-use, object
        oriented interface. Other components, such as <classname>Zend_Auth</classname> and
        <classname>Zend_Acl</classname>, provide user authentication and authorization against
        all common credential stores. Still others implement client libraries to simply access
        to the most popular web services available. Whatever your application needs are, you're
        likely to find a Zend Framework component that can be used to dramatically reduce
        development time with a thoroughly tested foundation.

        The principal sponsor of the Zend Framework project is <ulink url="http://www.zend.com">
        Zend Technologies</ulink>, but many companies have contributed components or significant
        features to the framework. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and StrikeIron have
        partnered with Zend to provide interfaces to web services and other technologies that they
        wish to make available to Zend Framework developers.
    </para>
    <para>
        Zend Framework could not deliver and support all of these features without the help of the
        vibrant ZF community. Community members, including contributors, make themselves available
        on <ulink url="http://framework.zend.com/archives">mailing lists</ulink>,
        <ulink url="http://www.zftalk.com">IRC channels</ulink>, and other forums. Whatever
        question you have about ZF, the community is always available to address it.
