        Let's say you're creating a blogging application that will be home to your vast
        collection of blog posts. There is a good chance that you do not want all of
        your blog posts to appear on one single page when someone visits your blog.
        An obvious solution would be to only display a small number of blog posts
        on the screen at a time, and allow the user to browse through the different pages,
        much like your favorite search engine shows you the result of your search query.
        <classname>Zend_Paginator</classname> is designed to help you achieve the goal of dividing
        collections of data in smaller, more manageable sets more easily, with more consistency,
        and with less duplicate code.
