    <title>Zend_Db Performance</title>

    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Db</classname> is a database abstraction layer, and is intended to
        provide a common <acronym>API</acronym> for <acronym>SQL</acronym> operations.
        <classname>Zend_Db_Table</classname> is a
        Table Data Gateway, intended to abstract common table-level database
        operations. Due to their abstract nature and the "magic" they do under
        the hood to perform their operations, they can sometimes introduce
        performance overhead.
    </para>

        <title>How can I reduce overhead introduced by Zend_Db_Table for
            retrieving table metadata?</title>

        <para>
            In order to keep usage as simple as possible, and also to support
            constantly changing schemas during development,
            <classname>Zend_Db_Table</classname> does some magic under the hood: on
            first use, it fetches the table schema and stores it within object
            members. This operation is typically expensive, regardless of the
            database -- which can contribute to bottlenecks in production.
        </para>

        <para>
            Fortunately, there are techniques for improving the situation.

        <sect3 id="performance.database.tableMetadata.cache">
            <title>Use the metadata cache</title>

            <para>
                <classname>Zend_Db_Table</classname> can optionally utilize
                <classname>Zend_Cache</classname> to cache table metadata. This is
                typically faster to access and less expensive than fetching the
                metadata from the database itself.
            </para>

                The <link linkend="zend.db.table.metadata.caching"><classname>Zend_Db_Table

        <sect3 id="performance.database.tableMetadata.hardcoding">
            <title>Hardcode your metadata in the table definition</title>

            <para>
                As of 1.7.0, <classname>Zend_Db_Table</classname> also provides <link
                    linkend="zend.db.table.metadata.caching.hardcoding">support
                for hardcoding metadata in the table definition</link>. This is
                an advanced use case, and should only be used when you know the
                table schema is unlikely to change, or that you're able to keep
                the definitions up-to-date.

        <title>SQL generated with Zend_Db_Select s not hitting my indexes; how
            can I make it better?</title>

        <para>
            <classname>Zend_Db_Select</classname> is relatively good at its job. However,
            if you are performing complex queries requiring joins or
            sub-selects, it can often be fairly naive.

            <para>
                The only real answer is to write your own <acronym>SQL</acronym>;
                <classname>Zend_Db</classname> does not require the usage of
                <classname>Zend_Db_Select</classname>, so providing your own, tuned
                <acronym>SQL</acronym> select statements is a perfectly legitimate approach,
            </para>
            <para>
                Run <constant>EXPLAIN</constant> on your queries, and test a variety of
                approaches until you can reliably hit your indices in the most
                performant way -- and then hardcode the <acronym>SQL</acronym> as a class property
                or constant.
            </para>

            <para>
                If the <acronym>SQL</acronym> requires variable arguments, provide placeholders in
                the <acronym>SQL</acronym>, and utilize a combination of
                <methodname>vsprintf()</methodname> and <methodname>array_walk()</methodname> to
                inject the values into the <acronym>SQL</acronym>:
