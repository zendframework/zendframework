    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname</classname> is the hostname route of
        the framework. It works similar to the standard route, but it works on
        the with the hostname of the called <acronym>URL</acronym> instead with the path.
    </para>

    <para>
        Let's use the example from the standard route and see how it would look
        like in a hostname based way. Instead of calling the user via a path,
        we'd want to have a user to be able to call
        <filename>http://martel.users.example.com</filename> to see the information
        about the user "martel":

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$hostnameRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname(
    ':username.users.example.com',
    array(
        'controller' => 'profile',
        'action'     => 'userinfo'
    )

$plainPathRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static('');

    <para>
        The first parameter in the <classname>Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname</classname>
        constructor is a route definition that will be matched to a hostname. Route
        definitions consist of static and dynamic parts separated by the dot
        ('.') character. Dynamic parts, called variables, are marked by
        prepending a colon to the variable name: <command>:username</command>.
        Static parts are just simple text: <command>user</command>.
    </para>

    <para>
        Hostname routes can, but never should be used as is. The reason behind
        that is, that a hostname route alone would match any path. So what you
        have to do is to chain a path route to the hostname route. This is done
        like in the example by calling <command>$hostnameRoute-&gt;chain($pathRoute);</command>.
        By doing this, <varname>$hostnameRoute</varname> isn't modified, but a new
        route (<classname>Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Chain</classname>) is returned,
        which can then be given to the router.
