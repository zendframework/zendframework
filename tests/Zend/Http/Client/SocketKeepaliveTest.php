/**
 * This Testsuite includes all Zend_Http_Client that require a working web
 * server to perform. It was designed to be extendable, so that several
 * test suites could be run against several servers, with different client
 * adapters and configurations.
 *
 * Note that $this->baseuri must point to a directory on a web server
 * containing all the files under the _files directory. You should symlink
 * or copy these files and set 'baseuri' properly.
 *
 * You can also set the proper constand in your test configuration file to
 * point to the right place.
