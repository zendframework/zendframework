This document serves as a list of BC breaks between the 1.x series and 2.0.
------------------------------

Zend_Loader_Autoloader:
 * Added "un/registerPrefix()" methods. These will handle classes that have a
   vendor prefix.
 * Modified the "un/registerNamespace()" methods to handle PHP 5.3 namespaces,
   and not vendor prefixes. If you are using registerNamespace() and have not
   updated your code to use namespaces, you should update your calls to use
   registerPrefix() instead.
 * push/unshiftAutoloader() now accepts a third, boolean argument for indicating
   whether the autoloader is a namespace or prefix autoloader. By default, it
   assumes it's a namespace autoloader. If you are registering a prefix
   autoloader in this way, pass a boolean "true" value as the third argument.

Zend_Config:
 * "Writer" renamed to "Writer\AbstractWriter"
 * "Writer_FileAbstract" renamed to "Writer\AbstractFileWriter"
 * "Writer_Array" renamed to "Writer\ArrayWriter"

Zend_Currency:
 * "Zend_Currency" prefix now becomes "Zend\Currency" namespace
 * "Zend_Currency" becomes "Zend\Currency\Currency"
 * "CurrencyInterface" is renamed to "CurrencyServiceInterface"

Zend_Log:
 * "Log" becomes "Logger"
 * "FactoryInterface" becomes "Factory"
   * Additionally, the factory() method's first argument is now optional,
     defaulting to "array()". If you have implemented this interface in the
     past, you will need to update your method signature.
 * "Filter_Interface" becomes "Filter"
 * "Filter_Abstract" becomes "Filter\AbstractFilter"
 * "Filter_Suppress" becomes "Filter\SuppressFilter"
 * "Formatter_Interface" becomes "Formatter"
 * "Writer_Abstract" becomes "Writer\AbstractWriter"
 * Created a new interface, "Writer"; typehint on this instead of
   "Writer\AbstractWriter"

Zend_Cache:
 * "Backend" renamed to "Backend\AbstractBackend"
 * "Backend_Interface" renamed to "Backend"
 * New interface created, "Frontend". Any previous typehints for
   "Zend_Cache_Core" should now be rewritten to "Zend\Cache\Frontend"
 * "Core" renamed to "Frontend\Core"
 * "Backend_ExtendedInterface" renamed to "Backend\ExtendedBackend"
 * "Backend_ZendServer" renamed to "Backend\ZendServer\AbstractZendServer"
 * "Backend_Static" renamed to "Backend\StaticBackend"
 * "Backend_Test" renamed to "Backend\TestBackend"
 * "Frontend_Class" renamed to "Frontend\ClassFrontend"
 * "Frontend_Function" renamed to "Frontend\FunctionFrontend"

Zend_Locale:
 * Locale data resources moved from Locale/Data/ to Locale/Data/resources/

Zend_Filter:
 * "Filter" broken into "FilterChain" and "StaticFilter"
   * For filter chains, use the new FilterChain class
   * For static usage, use the new StaticFilter class
     * Additionally, "filterStatic()" was renamed to "execute()"
 * "FilterInterface" renamed to "Filter"
   * Interface now defines "__invoke($value)" instead of "filter($value)". If
     you have created custom filters in the past, you will need to now implement
     Zend\Filter\Filter and rename your filter() method to __invoke().
 * "Compress_CompressInterface" renamed to "Compress\CompressionAlgorithm"
 * "Compress_CompressAbstract" renamed to "Compress\AbstractCompressionAlgorithm"
 * "Encrypt_Interface" renamed to "Encrypt\EncryptionAlgorithm"
   * Added "toString()" method to the interface; please update implementing
     classes accordingly
 * "Word_Separator_Abstract" renamed to "Word\AbstractSeparator"; please update
   extending classes accordingly.
 * Input:
   * "VALIDATE" constant removed in favor of "VALIDATOR" (already defined, but
     previously never used)
   * Class loading always uses namespaces now

Zend_Validate:
 * "Validate" broken into "ValidatorChain" and "StaticValidator"
 * "Zend_Validate" prefix now becomes "Zend\Validator" namespace
 * "ValidatorInterface" moved to "Zend\Validator\Validator"
 
Zend_Translate
 * "Zend_Translate" prefix now becomes "Zend\Translator" namespace
 * "Zend_Translate" becomes "Zend\Translator\Translator"
 * "Zend\Translator\Adapter\Array" renamed to "Zend\Translator\Adapter\ArrayAdapter"
 * Translation adapter interface is now "Zend\Translate\Adapter"

Zend_Acl
 * "Zend_Acl_Role_Interface" becomes "Zend\Acl\Role"
 * "Zend_Acl_Role" becomes "Zend\Acl\Role\GenericRole"
 * "Zend_Acl_Resource_Interface" becomes "Zend\Acl\Resource"
 * "Zend_Acl_Resource" becomes "Zend\Acl\Resource\GenericResource"
 * "Zend_Acl_Assert_Interface" becomes "Zend\Acl\Assertion"
 * Acl class:
   * "add()" removed
   * "get()" renamed to "getResource()"
   * "has()" renamed to "hasResource()"
   * "inherits()" renamed to "resourceInherits()"
   * "remove()" renamed to "removeResource()"
   * "removeAll()" renamed to "removeResourceAll()"
   * Removed "getRegisteredResources()" method (marked as deprecated)

Zend_Console
 * "Zend_Console_Getopt_Exception" becomes "Zend\Console\GetoptException"

Zend_Dom
 * "Zend_Dom_Query_Result" becomes "Zend\Dom\NodeList"
 * "Zend_Dom_Query_Css2Xpath" becomes "Zend\Dom\Css2Xpath"
 * "Zend_Dom_Query::query()" becomes "Zend\Dom\Query::execute()"
